Since I began my journey as a developer, the open-source community has been an invaluable source of support and learning. Thanks to it, I've had access to code examples, integrations with external services, and libraries that have greatly simplified my work. This constant generosity and collaboration made me feel indebted to the open-source world. That's how [Opire](https://opire.dev) was born.

There are numerous ways to support open-source and its philosophy. The most well-known include GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, and ko-fi. However, these platforms often channel donations without a specific goal, which may not be the most beneficial option in the long term. I'm not suggesting that financially rewarding the resolution of issues should replace these forms of support, but rather that it complements them, offering unique advantages that the other options can't provide.

## Benefits of Financial Rewards for Open-Source Project Issues
There are numerous benefits to financially rewarding contributions to open-source projects. When you reward a behavior, it tends to be repeated. Just as when you praise someone for a job well done, that person feels more motivated and will want to continue doing good work to gain recognition. Financial rewards are an excellent way to value effort and dedication.

While rewards can take many forms, such as words of appreciation or public recognition, money adds a tangible value that can be especially beneficial for the developer. By placing an economic value on the effort, it acknowledges and supports the work in a more substantial way, thereby incentivizing the continuity and quality of contributions to open-source.

### 🚀💪 Improve Motivation and Productivity

When we have a clear goal, our productivity increases significantly, and if that goal comes with the possibility of earning a reward, our motivation soars even higher. Although developers enjoy coding, sometimes we lose the drive that keeps us working for long hours. One effective way to stay motivated is by having close targets; small objectives help us maintain focus on what truly matters at that moment. This is why it is more effective to reward specific issues rather than donate money to the project in general.

For those offering the reward, they are interested in resolving a particular issue because it causes problems or unlocks a crucial functionality. From the developer's perspective, seeing a small, quickly achievable goal provides additional motivation to work on that specific issue.

### 🎮🏆 Gamification of Issue Resolution

Adding a reward element turns issue resolution into a more fun and engaging activity. Just as games keep players competing for points and achievements, rewards incentivize developers by offering tangible prizes for their efforts. This gamification fosters greater participation and creates a more dynamic and vibrant community. Additionally, it creates an environment where developers healthily compete to earn the prize as quickly as possible, meaning that rewarded issues will be resolved faster than those that don't generate the same interest.

### 🔝✅ Promoting Quality Contributions

When a reward is at stake, developers are more likely to put in their best effort to provide high-quality solutions. Motivated by the desire to earn the prize as quickly as possible, they will aim to minimize friction during the code review process and be prompt in addressing any review issues. This results in more robust code, with thorough testing and well-documented contributions. It's a classic case of "you get what you pay for." The larger the reward, the higher the quality of the contribution.

### 🌱⚙️ Avoid Open-Source Project Stagnation

Thousands of open-source projects become stagnant because they can't evolve at the pace their users demand. I've come across incredibly interesting projects where, due to a lack of time and resources, maintainers end up burned out and consider abandoning what they built from scratch. Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, and OpenCollective, while useful, are often not sufficient to sustain a project because they don't address the root issue. Donating money to the project in general doesn't accumulate a significant amount to keep it going. However, by offering rewards for specific issues, a larger sum can be reached, and it also doesn't require the maintainer to spend additional time beyond reviewing pull requests. Thus, rewarding issues proves to be a more effective alternative than simply donating money to the project without a clear goal.

### 👨‍💻💨 Faster Issues Resolution

Thanks to gamification and the increased motivation we've discussed, issues are resolved much more quickly. This is crucial for maintaining a high-quality product with the latest features and fewer bugs. Companies cannot afford to rely on unresolved issues in open-source projects they use. This drives companies to be the main stakeholders in rewarding issues in those projects. By allowing any interested programmer to handle the development, the primary maintainers are freed up to focus solely on reviewing pull requests, which accelerates the project's evolution.

### 🔍🌟 Attracting the Best Talents

Another benefit of rewarding contributions for issues instead of donating money to the project is that it attracts high-quality talent. This is advantageous both for the project and for companies looking to hire new employees. Developers incentivized by rewards will showcase their skills through tangible contributions, allowing companies to assess their work and determine if they meet their expectations. Additionally, by attracting new contributors, the project benefits from fresh perspectives and approaches, which can drive innovation and enhance overall development.

### 📚🧠 Improve Existing Talent

Current contributors can enhance their skills by working on real projects. Introducing oneself to a new language or tool can be challenging, and basic projects, such as a typical TODO app, often aren't sufficient to fully grasp all the concepts. The best way to learn is by applying those concepts in a functioning project. This is why new developers may choose to resolve issues in existing projects, which not only helps them gain experience and improve their skills but also enriches the talent pool of the contributing community.

### ♻️🛠️ Sustainability of Open-Source

Many developers love contributing to open-source, but they often struggle to find the time or resources to do so consistently. The current open-source landscape is frequently unsustainable. Often, it is the companies behind these projects that ensure their sustainability by providing the necessary resources, while many individuals are forced to abandon their side projects. Offering financial incentives helps developers justify the time they invest in open-source projects, thereby contributing to the sustainability and longevity of these projects.

### 🤝💬 Creating a Supportive Community

Resolving issues in a project strengthens the sense of community within it. This collaborative environment not only enhances the quality of solutions but also allows developers to learn from each other and refine their skills. Moreover, this interaction can lead to new ideas and features for the project, enriching its development and growth.

## Opire Takes Action!

Opire is a rewards platform designed to create a mutually beneficial environment for both developers and reward creators.

Opire connects two parties interested in improving open-source projects. On one hand, we understand that developers want to focus on coding without being bogged down by bureaucracy and management. On the other hand, we know that individuals and companies need certain issues in their favorite projects resolved.

Additionally, the open-source community has always needed more support. Maintainers often feel overwhelmed, with limited time to dedicate to their projects and increasing demands from users. That's why they have always been open to external contributions.

The idea is to provide developers with a marketplace of issues where they can collaborate and earn money, while those who want to see their issues resolved can offer financial rewards to encourage developers to tackle them.

## Great, but... How Does Opire Work?

On Opire, anyone can create a reward for any open-source project. This is crucial for growing the open-source community, allowing everyone to contribute their part. Additionally, rewards accumulate: while not everyone can offer large sums, if everyone contributes a little, significant amounts can be gathered. This means that a single issue can have rewards from multiple people, and even multiple rewards from the same person.

To create a reward on Opire, you have two options:

- (Recommended) From the creator dashboard on Opire, click "Create Reward." You'll only need the URL of the GitHub issue and the amount you're willing to pay upon resolution. Don't worry, you won't need to make any payment at this stage 😉. This method works for any GitHub repository.
- For projects with the Opire bot installed: In the specific issue where you want to create a reward, use the command /reward 50, where 50 is the amount in dollars you're willing to pay upon resolution.

It's that simple. Once the reward is created, you just need to wait for a developer to resolve the issue and claim the rewards. You can make the payment when the developer creates a Pull Request and claims the reward, but in most cases, it's preferable to pay once the Pull Request has been merged. We offer the option to pay when the developer creates the PR claiming the reward because there may be cases where the Pull Request itself provides value even if it's not merged into the main codebase.

## So Easy! And What's The Price?

Currently, Opire charges a transaction fee of 4% to reward creators. Thanks to our low operating costs, we can offer this fee at a very reasonable rate. This means that the programmer receives 100% of the proposed reward, and the reward creator will only need to pay a small additional amount when completing the payment. You can see the final price by using the [calculator](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/pricing#playground) in our documentation.
