				With Opire, anyone can create rewards in <a
					class="link-in-text"
					href="https://app.opire.dev/projects"
					target="_blank">repositories that have the app installed</a
				> using our commands. Rewards can start from $20. In addition to
				adding rewards to issues, anyone can show appreciation for a user's
				effort with tips starting from $1.
			</Text>
			<Spacer size={20} />
			<Text>
				An issue can have multiple rewards associated with it,
				regardless of whether it's the same user creating them or
				several users contributing different amounts: at the time of
				payment, each user will be responsible for paying their share.

				If someone outside the repository's organization creates a
				reward, the organization will receive a % when it's paid to the
				developer.

				Pay when someone claims your rewards associated with the issue.
			</Title2>

			<Text>
				Once the developer has claimed the rewards for the issue and it
				has been verified that the proposed change meets expectations,
				you can pay the rewards you created for that issue from your
				dashboard. In case there are multiple developers who have
				claimed the same issue, you can choose whom to pay. It is the
				developer's responsibility to ensure that their account is
				correctly configured to receive payments.

				This is when the reward transfer will take place along with the
				associated costs being charged.

				If several people create rewards for the same issue, each
				creator will pay the sum of the rewards they have created.
