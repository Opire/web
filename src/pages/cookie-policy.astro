    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: August 17, 2024</p>
    <p>
      We use cookies to help improve your experience of our website at&nbsp;<a
        href="https://opire.dev/">https://opire.dev</a
      >. This cookie policy is part of Opire LLC's privacy policy. It covers the
      use of cookies between your device and our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also provide basic information on third-party services we may use, who
      may also use cookies as part of their service. This policy does not cover
      their cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don&rsquo;t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct
      your browser to refuse cookies from&nbsp;<a href="https://opire.dev/"

    <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>
      A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
      when you visit. It typically contains information about the website
      itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
      browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie&rsquo;s
      purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), track site
      usage (e.g. analytics), store your user settings (e.g. time zone,
      notification preferences), and to personalize your content (e.g.
      advertising, language).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as
      first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that
      particular site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are called
      third-party cookies. They can be used to track you on other websites that
      use the same third-party service.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
    <p><strong>Essential cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling
      core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts, and
      payment processing.
    </p>
    <p>We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.</p>
    <p><strong>Performance cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Performance cookies track how you use a website during your visit.
      Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated, with information
      tracked across all site users. They help companies understand visitor
      usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may
      encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their
      audience&rsquo;s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by
      the website you&rsquo;re visiting (first-party) or by third-party
      services. They do not collect personal information about you.
    </p>
    <p>We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</p>
    <p><strong>Functionality cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Functionality cookies are used to collect information about your device
      and any settings you may configure on the website you&rsquo;re visiting
      (like language and time zone settings). With this information, websites
      can provide you with customized, enhanced, or optimized content and
      services. These cookies may be set by the website you&rsquo;re visiting
      (first-party) or by third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</p>
    <p><strong>Targeting/advertising cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Targeting/advertising cookies help determine what promotional content is
      most relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use
      them to deliver targeted advertising or limit the number of times you see
      an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their
      campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may
      be set by the website you&rsquo;re visiting (first-party) or by
      third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties
      may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party
      service.
    </p>
    <p>We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</p>
